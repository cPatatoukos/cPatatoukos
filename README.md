- 👋 Hi, I’m @cPatatoukos
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Laravel and always practicing JavaScript and perfecting HTML & CSS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, either as a front-end developer (which I am good at) or as a back-end developer (which I am currently learning) oooor as a fullstack developer (shocking, I know...).
- 📫 You can reach me through my email: charalampos.patatoukos@gmail.com, I'll be happy to reach back at you in no time!
